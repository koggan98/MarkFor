Market Analysis and Forecasting – Files Explanation
Students: Sven Träger, Daniel Kogan

Environment and Tools
The entire analysis was conducted using R in a Jupyter Notebook (via the R kernel).
This setup enabled a structured and transparent workflow that combines code, comments, and results in one document.

Included Files:
markfor_analysis_notebook.ipynb
    The original Jupyter Notebook containing all code, explanations, and output.
    Most modern IDEs (e.g., VSCode with Jupyter support) can open and run it.

markfor_analysis_notebook.pdf
    A PDF export of the notebook, provided in case the .ipynb file cannot be opened directly.
    The individual outputs of the cells can be viewed without the need to run the code.

markfor_analysis_script.R
    A standalone R script containing all code from the notebook, ready to run in any standard R environment (e.g., RStudio, R GUI, R terminal).

Notes on Execution
The .ipynb file requires a Jupyter environment with R kernel support (e.g., JupyterLab, or VSCode with appropriate extensions).

The .R script is self-contained and can be executed without Jupyter.

All necessary packages are listed at the top of the script.
If not already installed, they can be added by uncommenting the second line (install.packages(...)).
